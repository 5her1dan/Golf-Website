   <h2> Plan Your Next Golf Trip </h2> 
        <p> When one thinks of Lincoln, NE, the first thing that usually comes to mind isn't golf, but rather the beloved Cornhusker football team.
            That is OK! We are here to help change that. Lincoln is a diverse, bustling college town with much to offer. One of those 
            offerings is great golf! Everything from fancy country-clubs, to spawling municipal courses, and everything in between is available in Lincoln.
            This site is a fantastic resource to help you decide on different course options and hopefully convice you on visiting our great city!
        </p>
       
        
    <h2> When to Visit? </h2>
        <p> When planning a golf trip to Lincoln, the most important thing to consider is weather. Nebraska isn't known for their great weather in the wintertime,
            so the best time to visit is the spring, summer, or fall. If you visit in the spring, expect the courses to be difficult as the conditions will be soft 
            and damp. Most courses will not be in the best shape due to the previous winter. The further along in the spring it goes, the better conditions will be. 
            The summer months are a great time for golf in Lincoln if heat and humidity aren't a bother for you. All area courses will be open by this time of year.
            Course conditions in the summer are ideal. Turf and greens should be in pristine condition. One downside to summer golf in Lincoln are the crowds. Everyone
            is golfing in the summer! Plan accordingly. Lastly, my favorite time of year to golf in Lincoln is the fall. Mild temperatures, good course conditions, and dwindling 
            crowds make the fall the best time to visit and golf in Lincoln. Also, you can catch a Husker football game in the fall!

        <p> Golf is a great sport because no matter the skill level, there will always be fun, exciting opportunities to play. For the courses in Lincoln, I divided the courses 
            by difficulty for each of the three common golf <a href="https://www.golflink.com/facts_8067_what-golf-handicap.html" target="_blank"> handicap levels.</a> High handicap players 
            are generally new to the game and not as highly skilled as more advanced players. Easier, shorter courses are preferrable for players with a high handicap index. 
            Mid-handicap players have a solid grasp on the fundamentals of the game. They usually fair well on most courses and most likely participate in competitive leagues
            and/or are a member at a club. Almost every course is playable for mid-handicap players in the Lincoln area. Low-handicap or "scratch" players as they are commonly
            referred to, are highly skilled at the game of golf. They seek out the challenging courses and are usually more open to paying higher prices per round. Every course is 
            playable for these players. Lincoln offers only a few of these challenging courses. Remember, these are only suggestions and do not limit players to certain courses. If
            a course looks fun and playable for you, go for it!
