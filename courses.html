            <dt> Jim Ager Memorial Golf Course </dt> 
            <dd> A short, Par 3 course in the heart of Lincoln. This is a great place to practice and have fun!
                 Being a Par 3 course (1,228 yards)with only 9 holes makes it very walkable and kid friendly! They also have a kids lesson program, 
                 a putting/chipping green, and rentable clubs. Rates are very affordable at &#36;12.00 for 9 holes.</dd> 
            <dt> Holmes Golf Course </dt> 
            <dd> 18-hole course built along the beautiful Holmes Lake in East Lincoln. This course offers something for everyone, 
                 with soft greens and wide fairways. You are sure to have a great time here. The staff is very friendly and helpful. 
                 Ammenities include 350-yard driving range, rental carts, pro shop, and a PGA Head Pro to help answer any questions.
                 Rates for 18-holes are &#36;23.00 per golfer. </dd>

    <h2> Mid-Handicap Recommendations </h2>
        <p> The following courses will fit just about anyones golf game! Great for large groups with varying skill levels. </p> 
        <dl> 
            <dt> Fairways Golf Course Lincoln</dt>
            <dd> This 3,200 yard, 9-hole course situated in North Lincoln is perfect for a solo round or a quick two-man game. 
                 The tight fairways are littered with trees making shots off the tee difficult. Sloping, hard greens will drive
                 you crazy here! Nonetheless, this is a great challenge without being too hard. Rates for 9 holes run &#36;14.00. </dd>
            <dt> Highlands Golf Course </dt> 
            <dd> Situated in North Lincoln near the airport, this 7,000 yard 18-hole course is an absoulute gem. Wide open fairways with large sand bunkers
                 give the impression of a Scottish links-style course. With very few trees on the property, this opem course offers great views. One draw back is
                 the wind which can be relentless due to no trees and the open setting.It will be a good test of your golf skills. This course, along with Holmes, 
                 Mahoney, and Jim Ager are all city owned courses.This makes them very accessible to any golfer! Rates are &#36;25.25 per 18 holes. </dd> 
        </dl>         
                      
    <h2> Low-Handicap Recommendations </h2>
        <p> These are the top-tier courses in Lincoln. They will chanllenge every golfer who plays a round. These courses are often fancier and more expensive, but
            that isn't always the case.</p>
        <dl>
            <dt> Firethorn Golf Club </dt>
            <dd> Probably Lincolns most exclusive course. This 18 hole masterpiece was designed by the wold famous Pete Dye. Offering one of the best challenges
                 Nebraska has to offer. Both the mens and womens teams at the University of Nebraska call this course home. Perfectly manicured greens and fairways 
                 greet you on every hole. The subtle design of this course lures you in to a false sense of confidence in your game and then suddenly jumps at you
                 when least expected. You'll be sure to remember every shot you took here, and it'll leave you pondering what could've been done differently. However, the 
                 most challenging thing about this course is getting a tee-time! Your best bet is knowing someone who is a member, but that is unlikely. Call early and see
                 if they have any openings. </dd> 
            <dt> Hidden Valley Golf Club </dt>
            <img src="images/hiddenValley.jpg" width="300" height="194" alt="Hidden Valley 1st Hole" id="hidden">
            <dd> This 18 hole course is a personal favorite of ours. Found just southeast of town, the course sits on a hilly acreage filled with trees and a meandering stream.
                 Playing at 6,200 yards, Hidden Valley has the perfect distance combined with a well thought out layout that makes it one of the best in Lincoln.
                 Originally designed and built in 1962, but was renovated in 2006. This renovation completely changed the course. It became much more challenging and
                 fun to play. It is semi-private, meaning it's both open to the public and offers memberships. A round of 18 holes will cost &#36;37.00, making up a good middle
                 ground between price and challenge. </dd>
